# Simon-Says

*ALL SOUND EFFECTS THAT WERE USED ARE FREE FOR USE*
***
This **_Simon Says_** game was created for a school project. 
The goal of the game is to make a GUI that plays a sequence that you will have to follow and play back the sequence once its finished.
After the sequence is successfully matched, the game goes to the next round, adding a new level at the end of the sequence.

If you click the incorrect button in the sequence or go five seconds without clicking, you will be prompted with a "Game Over" screen that displays the round you got to. 
Here, you are able to choose to  play again, or exit the game.

> _Note:_
> In the .\out\build\x64-Debug folder, there will be a **SimonSays.exe** that can run the game.
> The required .wav sound files, TGUI, and SFML library files have been added for the game to run properly.

### Techniques used
This project was coded using C++ and generated using a CMakeList.txt file. The GUI and sounds effects for the game are made from using TGUI and SFML that were used in the project seperately and are not included here. TGUI also has a GUI builder that made it easier to lay all of the components out easier. Once they were layoued out they were rendered in the form.txt file, to allow the components to be accessed in the code.
